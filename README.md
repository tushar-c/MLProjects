Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations.
These implementations serve as simplified examples for conceptual understanding of machine learning algorithms (mostly on the iris datset). 
These are not meant to be of production-level standards, but rather are simplified examples to promote conceptual understanding of the core concepts.
